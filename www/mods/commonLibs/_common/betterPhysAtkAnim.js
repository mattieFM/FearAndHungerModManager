@help
In the default system, this only happens for the "attack" skill.
This plugin allows you to have actors draw their weapon when using some
or all skills.

By default, all skills which have a hit type of "physical attack" will
use the weapon animations. To turn this off, set the plugin parameter
"CCPS_PhysicalUseWeapon" to false.

To make all skills of particular types use the weapon animations, add
the skill types to the "CCPS_SkillTypesUseWeapon" plugin parameter.
e.g. for the "Special" type in a default project, set this to "2"

These tags can be used to make individual skills use the weapon
animation:
<CCPS_weapon:true> - this skill uses the weapon animation
<CCPS_weapon:false> - this skill does not use the weapon animation

Skill note tags override the plugin parameters for that skill.
