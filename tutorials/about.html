    <h1>A modding api for fear and hunger 1 and 2.</h1>
    &emsp;This project at its core is a modding api for fear and hunger 1 and 2, it is mostly generic and can be adapted to most rpgmaker mv games. If you are looking to make 
    this modding api support another game add me on discord and I can help walk you through the process.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;This project provides a way to mod Fear and Hunger in a non-destructive runtime environment. Rather than needing to replace all the game files you can just use a mod, 
    additionally this allows massive modding compatibility between mods so that multiple mods can be run at the same time.

    &emsp;If you are an author of a overhaul mod and would like to port your overhaul mod to be a plugin based mod instead see
