<h2>Not Connecting to server</h2>
If you have been sent here by the game, then it is taking a while to connect and it should not take this long. Feel free to wait a little while (5 or so min any more is excessive). 
If waiting does not resolve it please refer to the list of factors that might effect connections below:
<h3>Broker server status</h3>
<p>
    Despite the mod being peer to peer we do rely on a small server for initializing connections this is called a broker server and is used to slight obscure ip adresses and make things
    generally easier. It rarely goes down as all it needs to do is send the key and map said key to the other peers ip. once connected it does nothing. If it remains down for a while please 
    message me and I will look into hosting one myself, but for the time being I have no need to do so. That said, first and foremost ensure it is up. if it is not wait a while. Msg me if its
    down for more than a day or 2 consistently.

You are not connected to the server,
			 this should not take this long.\n
			 Feel free to try to wait longer, but if that does not work please refer to the following:\n
			 <li>Make sure you are submitting the code by pressing "enter" not "z" as sometimes "z" will type z.</li>
			 0: I opened the broker server status in your browser, if those are down then wait an hour or two and they should be back up.\n
				if not dont worry about it.
			 1: ensure you entered the code properly.\n
			 2: reload/relaunch your client\n
			 3: reload/relaunch your server\n
			 4: ensure your PC firewall is not blocking fear and hunger\n
			 5: ensure your are not on a wifi hotspot (this will sometimes not work due to how hotspots mess with IPs, 
			if you need a hotspot use a vpn to work around this issue)\n
			 6: ensure your Router firewall is not blocking fear and hunger.\n
			 7: sometimes vpns can either help or break it, so enable/disable them if you have them.\n
			 8: reinstall the game
