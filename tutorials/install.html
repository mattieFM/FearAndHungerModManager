    In previous version of the mod the multiplayer and other mods were separate, now they are the same. 
    Past multiplayer beta/alpha builds will still work. But all mods are included in the <b>Stable</b> version. <b>In other words, just download the version tagged "Latest"</b>

    <h1>Windows Installer</h1>
    Note: some people said this installer also works on mac and linux but I don't think it will, use at your own risk if not on windows.
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the release you would like to download IE: latest build. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattieFM/FearAndHungerModManager/releases">Releases</a></li>
        <li>Expand the 'assets' dropdown.</li>
        <li>Click the "RPGModManagerInstall.exe" button.</li>
        <li>The download for the installer will begin.</li>
        <li>Wait for the download to finish.</li>
        <li>Run the installer. You might get a message form windows defender, just click allow.</li>
        <li>Follow the steps of the installer and select your game folder when prompted to, IE: the folder containing the 'game.exe' file.</li>
        <li>Mods are now installed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Manual Install</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the release you would like to download IE: latest build. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattieFM/FearAndHungerModManager/releases">Releases</a></li>
        <li>Expand the 'assets' dropdown.</li>
        <li>Click the "Source Code (Zip)" button</li>
        <li>Wait till the file is downloaded.</li>
        <li>Extract the zip files.</li>
        <li>Open the folder your game is stored in. This is the folder that contains the 'game.exe' file and the 'www/' folder.</li>
        <li>Drag and drop the www/ folder of the downloaded files into the game folder. Choose "yes" when it asks you if you would like to replace overlapping files.</li>
        <li>Now the modloader and all my mods are installed, launch the game and toggle on or off any mods you would like</li>
    </ol>
    If you followed the above then your mods are installed now. <br>
    <br>
    
    <b>IMPORTANT:</b> if the game is not working after following the above keep reading.<br>
    For the modloader to work you need to copy one folder and replace one file. Coping the www/ folder into the game files should do that for you (as shown above) but if it didn't work then:
    <ol>
        <li>Replace the game file 'www/index.html' with the one I provided in the same path within the download</li>
        <li>Add the mods folder within the download to the /www/ folder of your game files</li>
    </ol>
